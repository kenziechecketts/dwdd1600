        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Position yourself. Stand just outside the court and aim for the box diagonal to you.</li>
            <li>Now you can serve. In Pickleball you serve underhand. With your dominant hand, position your paddle underneath the ball while holding the ball in your non dominant hand. Now you're ready to hit the ball.</li>
            <li>Once the ball is in play. Keep rallying back and forth over the net until someone faults.</li>
            <li>Anything that goes past or lands outside of the white lines that outline the court is considered to be out. Anything that lands out is considered to be a fault.</li>
            <li>Throughtout the game consider moving up to the net to volley the ball. However when your team is serving you can not move up to net until your opponent has returned the ball and <strong>the ball has bounced on your side of the court.</strong></li>
            <li>Up at the front of the court there is long rectangular box that is positioned right before the net, in Pickleball this box is referred to as <em>the Kitchen. </em><strong>It's very important to remember</strong> that you can only step into this box if you are hitting the ball underhand. <strong>You can not spike or volley the ball while standing in <em>the Kitchen</em>.</strong> If you do spike or volley the ball while standing in the kitchen that is considered to be a fault.</li>
        </ol>
            
        <h2>Additional Rules for Serving</h2> 
            <dl>
                <li>When it is your teams turn to serve, the player on the right always serves first.</li>
                <li>When you are serving, rememeber to switch sides after each point.</li>
                <li>The first server continues to serve until your team faults.</li>
                <li>Any serve that goes past or lands outside of the service box (the box diagonal to you) is out and considered to be a fault.</li>
                <li>After the first server has served and your team has faulted, the second player on your team then has the opportunity to serve, and they continue to serve until your team faults.</li>
                <li>Once both people on your team have had the opportunity to serve, the ball then goes to the opposing team and they get to serve the ball.</li>
            
            </dl>
            
        <h3>How to Score the Game</h3> 
            <dl>
                <li>In Pickleball you can only score points when your team is serving the ball.</li>
                <li>Keeping score is fairly simple, you simply count up in numerical order each time you get a point.</li>
                <li>When you are serving and calling the score remember to always say your teams score first and then the other teams score. For example say your team has 3 points and the other teams has 1 point, when calling the score you would say 3,1 before serving the ball.</li>
