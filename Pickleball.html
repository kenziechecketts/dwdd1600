        <h2>The History of Pickleball</h2> 
            <dl>
                <dt>Who invented Pickleball?</dt>
                <dd>Pickleball was invented by a group of 3 men; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Pritchard" rel="noopener">Joel Pritchard</a>, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum</dd>
                <dt>How was it invented?</dt>
                <dd>The sport of Pickleball was created by mere accident. One day Pritchard, Bell, and McCallum and their families had gathered together and they had quickly become bored. They rememebered that they had a badminton court however they soon discovered that they didn't have enough badminton rackets, so they resorted to using ping pong paddles. They also discovered that they didn't have a badminton birdie so they resorted to a wiffle ball. This makeshift game soon evolved into a competitive and well known sport known as Pickleball.</dd>
                <dt>Why is it called Pickleball?</dt>
                <dd>Pritchard decided to name it Pickleball because he was trying to reference to a "pickle boat". A Pickle boat is a term associated with crew boat racing. The Pickle boat was referred to as the boat that finished last in the race. This makes sense why this inspired the name Pickleball because it is a farely new sport and <em>"last in the race".</em></dd>
